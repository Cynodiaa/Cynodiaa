# Hello Github! 

- Greetings, I'm Cynodia. I'm 17 years old. I've been using discord for about 5 years. I have been dealing with software for the last 4 years. 2 years ago I started to develop bots and projects on discord. Apart from bot development, I designed applications, websites, plugins, scripts and tiny games for Windows. The software language that interests me the most is Java, and I have produced the most projects over the Java language. I know intermediate java and now i am trying to learn advanced java. The contribution of my friends was great when I started this job, now I want to reach much bigger places. Developing bots in Discord and designing plugins for servers was a start for me. Keep learning. You can easily find me on Discord with the hashtag [Cynodia#0228](https://discord.com/users/932692365859246112). Stay well, I love
